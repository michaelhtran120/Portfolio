# Website Portfolio

This was a quick build to replace an expiring portfolio page I had on Squarespace. Will be using this portfolio repo as a testing grounds for interesting UI styling and features that I find.

Hope to revamp this once I have spare time to really explore portfolio layouts and explore ways to express myself through the code I showcase via my portfolio.

## Things I learned from this project.
 - Transferring host domain from Squarespace. This was a confusing process at first. Needed to learn about DNS and SSL/TLS certificates for encryption.
