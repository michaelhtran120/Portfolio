              <h3>Understanding the Market</h3>
              <p>For those unfamiliar to the skincare industry, it is a multi-billion dollar multifaceted industry that promotes health and self-care. In order to begin assisting our client, we needed to deep dive into what made this industry into what it is today as well as potential future growth. </p>
              <p>
                Most projections saw the entire skincare market growing to about $180 billion by 2025. Although the skincare industry is in the billions, our focus was on the skincare device part of the industry, which only accounts for a small fraction of the entire market. The device market was valued at $9.1 billion in 2018 and projected for about $18 billion by 2024. This would account for about 10% of the total market. (This number includes devices ranging from personal use to clinical use)
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of research here is so we could better aide our client in competing in the device market of this industry. Our first initial meeting with the client, we wanted to understand their interest in this market and why they decided to be players in this industry. With their goal in mind , we laid out plans to find out how the market is currently trending.

              <h3>Asking Questions</h3>
              <p>
                We began with a general research of the skin care industry and its history to find out what questions were the best thing to ask potential customers in the market. We then created a survey to quickly gather quantitative data to see how people view the industry, their habits, needs and desires in relation to skin care. This survey provided insight to which demographic of the market that would be most responsive to Pibu's entrance to the market. We then reached out to several participants for a more in depth interview to get qualitative data for analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clarisonic, a skincare device brand that had a 14% share of the device market, was determined a major competitor of our clients. Several of our interviewees noted their use of Clarisonic as part of the skincare regimen. During this time of our research, Clarisonic announced that they would be shutting down. This gave our client an opening to capture more of the market with a major competitor leaving.

              <h3 className='pb-3'>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p>The final step of our initial research was focused on conducting a competitive analysis on companies our client considered direct competition. Per our client, they believe Foreo and Meejee as there two main competitors. The competitive analysis helped us see how we could potentially help our client be different and compete from both a business and user-centered design point of view.
